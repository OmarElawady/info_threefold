- billing/pricing engine integration on Substrate

### planetary network integration

### Changes in billing model

Post usage billing makes lide much more easy.

### Zero-OS 3.0

New version of Zero-OS with many updates on network, compute & storage layer.

## Other Ideas for 3.0 release (not approved yet to be part of 3.0)

### network wall feature

The most secure way how to connect external services to your compute & storage workloads

### IPFS support

- Build in support for hypercore/ipfs, basically allow IPFS or HyperDrive to connect to our storage backend, this way our more robust reliable storage system can be a backend for these known P2P storage mechanisms without losing data ownership properties.

### 0-stor web frontend for machines (REST)

- HTTP REST & SSH based front end on top of the 0-Stor
- Allows anyone to easily store large amounts of data on top of 0-Stor using our distributed storage algorithm.
