# Farming Reward Table


!!!include:reward_table_

#### Remarks


- TFTs farmed go to a staking mechanism per node and only unlock if +30% of the 3Node's capacity is used or max after 24 months.
- Minimal SLA's need to be achieved before the farming reward can be earned (uptime, bandwidth, latency, ...)
- More info see [Farming Hardware Calculator](farming_calculator)
