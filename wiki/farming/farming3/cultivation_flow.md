# Cultivation Flow

This document describes how TFT are used to buy capacity from the TFGrid by means of using our TF_Channels.

Income mentioned below is after [discount](staking_discount_levels).

### When capacity bought by Certified Sales Channel

We expect most of the business for next 6 months to come through our certified sales channels

- [ ] 25% needs to be burned
- [ ] 5% to TFFoundation 
- [ ] 10% to farmer 
- [ ] the remainder goes to certified sales channel (can be multi level, as organized by TFTech and/or ThreeFold)

### When capacity bought by Farmer itself

- [ ] 25% needs to be burned
- [ ] 75% to farmer

### When capacity bought by person as referred to by farmer.

- [ ] 25% to be burned
- [ ] 5% to TFFoundation
- [ ] 50% to Farmer (because farmer found the user of the grid, CU/SU only)
- [ ] 20% goes to sales channel (can be multi level, as organized by ThreeFold)

### When capacity bought by any Grid User

We expect this to be small in beginning

- [ ] 25% to be burned
- [ ] 5% to TFFoundation
- [ ] 10% to farmer
