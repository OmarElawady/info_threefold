## ThreeFold Token (TFT)

![](img/token_internet.png)

ThreeFold Token is the token of the new internet. It is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the ThreeFold_Grid â€“ generated only when active capacity is added to the ThreeFold_Grid.

It has a specific commercial utility, since ThreeFold_Tokens were conceived as the designated currency for buying and selling capacity on the ThreeFold_Grid.

TFTs have not simply been minted and there was never an initial coin offering of any kind. TFTs are exclusively produced through a process called farming, which means that TFTs are generated only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold_Grid. There is no wasteful mining.

TFT is part of the Stellar Network (https://stellar.org).
