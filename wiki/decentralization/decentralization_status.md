# Decentralization Status

We believe we are well under way to being a decentralized movement. ThreeFold has been designed to be decentralized – there are more than 100 independent active parties (ThreeFold Farmers) building the ThreeFold Grid today.

## Decentralized and available today

- The ThreeFold Token (TFT) is on a public blockchain – in this case, Stellar.
- This provides very good security and decentralization for everyone.
- The TFT can be exchanged on Stellar decentralized exchange and other decentralized exchanges. See [here](how_to_buy_and_sell).
- Independent farmers add capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.
- All capacity is registered on TFDirectory (our [TFExplorer](https://explorer.threefold.io)) and signed by the Farmer 3Node.
- All technology is open source and everyone can see progress, ask for feature requests, check/audit the code, etc – via Github.
- TF Grid IT workloads are distributed using the Smart Contract for IT (multi-signature capability).
- TF Foundation is for promotion only (Mazraa, which is a sub-brand, is also a farmer).
- Measurement of capacity is done per 3Node.
- Measurement of uptime is done per 3Node and distributed.
- Minting (creation of new tokens) is all done by means of code and validated by the TFGrid_Guardians.
- Every minting operation since the start of the blockchain creates a proof document.
  - The hash is put in the transaction of the minting operation.
  - This means there is proof of every minting operation.
  - Also, [block0](genesis_block_pool_details) has been documented.
- A multi-signature wallet exists for rewarding people gifted TFT for contributions made to the project.
- TF Foundation & TF Tech use a priority management tool to let everyone have input on priorities and manage work well (see [circles.threefold.me](https://circles.threefold.me)).
- Our council structure – see [Threefold Councils](threefold_councils) – is like a human blockchain and protects the values of ThreeFold.

## New decentralization planned for H2 2021

- As part of our TF Grid 3.0, we have new exciting blockchain capabilities
  - Multiple blockchain: Stellar, Parity, and now looking into Polkadot parachain.
  - Money & consensus separated blockchain
  - See [TFGrid 3.0 Consensus Mechanism Specifications](internet4:consensus3) (technical).
  - TF Grid data objects are stored on Parity/Substrate-based decentralized blockchain database (phonebook, tfdirectory)
- Again, ThreeFold has been designed to be decentralized – many farmers together provide the infrastructure for the new Internet built by everyone for everyone. We are now preparing for the next phase:
  - We want to create 2-3 legal global structures in which we can accept funding and get approval from the government for the structure and token
    - This will have an impact on how to organize our Foundation
    - Restructuring will be done done in Belgium, Dubai, & Switzerland
    - As part of our ThreeFold_30 launch, we hope to be able to sell some Foundation TFT, which can fund these operations.

## Perception

- We can always improve on perception
  - Some people perceive the foundation as too centralized
  - The foundation is only a promotion vehicle
  - We need to make sure everyone understands this and sees how we reach out to the community for advice and support
  - Some people have multiple hats on (e.g. Kristof works for TF Foundation and for TF Tech)
    - We believe there is no conflict of interest today because the "interest" between TF Tech and TF Foundation is 100% aligned
  - We need to be more vocal about the fact that we are a community
    - It's not just some people dictating direction
    - Among other strategies, we use our own priority management tool to coordinate on decisions (again, see [circles.threefold.me](https://circles.threefold.me))

## Remark: We believe in the good of people and relying on "human blockchains"

This is why we have implemented our [council structure](threefold_councils).

- We are using code (software) to do all the minting (creation of tokens)
- In v2.0 we still use a "human blockchain" to validate the minting operation (validation of the minting)
- The code used in this process is open source and can be found in the code repos
- We found out that this actually a requirement for the possibility to become a licensed token/digital currency in certain regions
