# Farming Reward Calculator

We have created a calculator to allow you to simulate your potential return on investment of becoming a Farmer. Different nodes will produce a different Storage Units (SU), Compute Units (CU), and Network Units (NU)

The [Farming Logic v3 document](farming_reward) describes how many TFT your node will receive. 

Thanks to our sales model you also do not have to sell the capacity of your server(s), as we leave incentive for our threefold_channel 's to run a business on top of it. However, farmers can do their own sales to increase their gains.

<!-- ## Example Hardware CU / SU Calculation

In the first tab of our calculator you will find a quick and easy way to calculate your SU and CU numbers.

## Example Simulation

With these numbers you can now simulate the scenario's think think are possible in both a DIY and a Certified setup.
Please note the difference in farming rewards to distinguish the two.

### Certified

## Risks

- ThreeFold Technology is not working
  - _FACT: The technology is already working today_
- The ThreeFold token does not appreciate in value
  - _Unlikely: The cloud business by itself is growing and with increasing update of the TF Grid as an alternative to the large cloud vendors there will be token scarsity._
  - _The ThreeFold_Council can make changes the business model to create more scarsity (e.g. burn a higher percentage of the tokens)._
- Digital Currencies become illegal
  - _Unlikely: TFT has a utility - TFT represents  unit of compute and storage capacity._
  - _Even if this would happen despite all logic, then normal FIAT currencies can be used.  The token is only a effective means of value exchange._
